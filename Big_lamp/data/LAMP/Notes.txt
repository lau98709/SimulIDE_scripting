Simulation of a large lamp (for educational use)
Lamp whose color changes depending on the current flowing through it.
2 modes:
- Proportional mode: the brightness of the lamp is proportional to the current flowing through it. When the current is greater than the value of "Current", the lamp flashes red to indicate a current overrun.
- Non-proportional mode: the lamp flashes erratically when the current is less than the value of "Current". The brightness is stable when the current is greater than "Current".

The properties must be modified in "filaments".

Development: this is a scripted component. The scripted component is "filament". A subcircuit has been built around "filament". This is linked to the disk, the graphic element, which constitutes the background of the lamp. A resistor is used to simulate the physical part of the lamp.

Usage: "LAMP" must be placed in a "data" subdirectory next to the simulation file. To insert the component into your ".sim1" simulation file, you can either add an <item> line in the .sim1 file with the value CircId="LAMP-xxx". Or, you can copy and paste it from the example .sim1 file.
